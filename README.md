> ## Objective of replicating the page:

* Learn about Bootstrap Framework: 

    * Following the video lesson to replicate the **UCD Resume - Rosie** CV page helped me learn better about Bootstrap;

* Improve the skills I have already learned:

    * Although it is not a page developed by me, by replicating the ``code`` of this page I was able to learn new skills and improve those I have learned since starting the Full Stack Software Development course, such as:
    
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * UX Planes        
        * Bootstrap Framework
